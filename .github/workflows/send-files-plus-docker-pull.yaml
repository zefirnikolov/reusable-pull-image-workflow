name: Reusable Pull Image Workflow

# Every caller which call this - will use this commands with its repository. Meaning this is just a template.
# Instead of writing the bellow commands over and over again, this can be reused. 
# if actions/checkout is made - it will download the repository of the caller workflow, not this repository! 
# this repository - even if it has files in it - they won't be seen in the caller workflow.
